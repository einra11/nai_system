                                                        The Balikatan Sagip Patubig Program (BSPP) was launched in 1999 to assist
                                                        local government units (LGU) to be financially and technically capable to implement communal
                                                        irrigation development, thus, effecting the spirit of devolution. It is jointly undertaken by
                                                        the Department of Agriculture (DA) thru NIA, LGUs, and Irrigators Associations with the LGUs primarily responsible for the Program.
                                                        BSPP covers both the construction and rehabilitation of communal irrigation systems. LGUs which 
                                                        have the technical and management capacities to undertake pre-engineering and construction activities are
                                                        left to do these. NIA provides technical assistance and support as necessary. Otherwise, NIA undertakes these activities upon the request of the LGUs.
                                                        LGUs wanting to avail of the BSPP assistance must comply with the guidelines set by 
                                                        the Department of Agriculture. They may contact NIA's regional and provincial irrigation offices, and the office
                                                        of the Manager of the Systems Management Department at the central office for more information.
